also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display . 	0
ability to play most discs - i tried dvd , vcd , dvd-r , audio cd and it played all 	1
downside is the size of the phone , it is big for today 's standard .	0
even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback . 	1
as one other reviewer pointed out , it does occasionally take a little effort to push down the " plunger " to get the diapers in the pail , even though upon inspection the bag doesn 't really look full .	0
simple click buttons , back buttons volume and display are very easy to read , access and use . 	1
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote , which is worse than other , cheaper apex units . 	0
bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago , and so far it has been excellent . 	1
the headphone jack seems to be a major problem . 	0
this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer . 	1
very sturdy and strong .	1
bottom line great phone for the time being .	1
the s100 's image quality rates in the middle of its class , but it can still be a reasonable choice for students , families , or small businesses looking for an ultra-portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack .	1
it 's still one of the smallest 2mp digital cameras on the market , and absolutely one of the best-built most stylish cameras ever .	1
but this by far is the best phone out there right now !	1
the creative zen micro , at first glance , is a dream come true for all mp3 and music lovers .	1
you have the option to have the flash automatic or off .	1
all i have to say is that the pics i get with my sd500 are both rich and color and high in detail , the user interface is awesome , the battery charger is tiny and super light and sd cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time .	1
i am giving a zero star to symantec for this version !	0
it was impossible to change the speed with just my fingers .	0
2 ) the delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots .	0
i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession -- great for action shots . 	1
you don 't need to cough up an extra couple bucks for a " special edition " to get black ! - sound : awesome ! - batteries : removable / replaceable .	1
* software is absolutely terrible : 	0
this was an awesome player , before the video output no longer worked ( after about 3 weeks ) . 	0
in general it is easy to use and well laid out . 	1
i would recommend this camera unequivocally !	1
now the bad : 1 ) as usual , battery power not sufficient for daily usuage .	0
with accessories , you can make the ipod into a digital recorder , broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology , and play it through your car speakers using either a cd adaptor or fm stereo broadcaster .	1
so much safer than the others that require a two handed operation !	1
not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp . 	1
all the features are incredibly intuitive , even for a novice like me .	1
it 's very quiet for a universal motor-driven tool , and the height adjustment stick and variable speed control are great .	1
the container is hard to open , which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler , and you do have to flip the handle carefully ( which has saved more than a few of her toys , too . ) i don 't consider these difficulties but features for the older baby .	1
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use . 	1
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying . 	1
2- it is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use .	0
it also costs a lot less than the ipod . 	1
just too numerous to list : fm radio , which has weak reception , but at least it there , and a microphone , to name just two .	0
the software was great , as long as you have an adminstrative user account ( windows xp ) . 	1
on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life . 	1
the menu is easy to use and understand .	1
the computer interface is 90 % good , only losing points due to the fact that " creative " branding is all over the place within it .	1
i love the touchpade controls .	1
the good : small size ; durable-seeming metal case ; easy to use ; visually distinctive ; good picture quality ; fast usb connection ; mostly intuitive operation ; really cool photostitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas .	1
so , i was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all .	1
only slight negatives i 've had so far is that i haven 't been able to get it to accept any of my wav files yet .	0
i 've had to install and uninstall them four or five times so far , and i 've not to get either product working properly .	0
i think this is it 's biggest flaw . 	0
and we definitely prefer our champ !	1
i love this product !	1
short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel . 	0
the zoom goes up and down in magnification , which is nice , but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings . 	0
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible . 	1
still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features ! 	1
this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod . 	1
getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience . 	0
however , it is much bigger , bulkier , and heavier than my other router and i would not like to use it freehand ( i keep it mounted in a table ) .	0
the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3/4 of the screen and the image still looked normal . 	1
will never purchase apex again . 	0
but , dollar for dollar , this dvd player is probably the best out there . 	1
the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc. other nicities , that you would enjoy . 	1
fits comfortably in my inside jacket pocket or in my pants pocket .	1
you can create playlists , drag & drop songs and playlists to your player , and rip directly from cd to your player . 	1
but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers . 	1
that said , i am disappointed in the plunging mechanism .	0
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased . 	1
although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product . 	0
first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer . 	1
fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 . 	1
if you need a wireless router .... get it get it get it .... works really good ....	1
after repeatly cleaning and recleaning , it still stuck after using it for a little while .	0
in conclusion , i gave the ipod a 4 / 5 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly .	1
has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range . 	1
the fm tuner , the 5g of storage , and the removable disk are all great features .	1
it 's the same body as the popular elp2 aps camera ( take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you 'll have an idea of the front profile ! ) .	1
it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted . 	1
the bass is deep and the treble is clear .	1
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise . 	1
still has terrible software .	0
the interface works great .	1
the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sais , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it on again , which is not to my likings . 	0
this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks .. . 	0
i use a nokia 6600 , it has a great color tft display and camera equipped with zoom , which complement a built-in video recorder with audio and a realone player for playback and streaming of 3gpp-compatible and realmedia video clips .	1
the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium . 	1
the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro . 	1
the remote is flimsy-feeling and awkward to use . 	0
all you have to do is click one button on the router configuration window and the router automatically senses the devices and configures the network .	1
i have only used it with the 1 / 4 " collet and a 1 / 2 " round over bit , but i love how it starts up with little torque and runs very quietly .	1
this phone is highly recommended otherwise . 	1
bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature ... but not on this player .. . 	0
the controls are hard to manipulate , especially in the dark .	0
enjoy .	1
they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department . 	1
have tried to contact apex via e-mail ( customerservice@apexdigital.com ) , but the e-mail address is not valid . 	0
i 've taken about hundred shot with the canon , in varying lighting situations , all in auto mode , and not one blurry picture ! ! !	1
the only problem i have is with the handle you use to open the top compartment .	0
i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind . 	1
i have n't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs . 	1
one neat thing - i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms - no problem for the camera - rooms looked like they had ample lighting . 	1
the size of the camera is perfect .	1
first , it serious , serious installation problems .	0
the log functions helps you track down the incoming , outgoing calls in the most easy of ways .	1
you can turn this phone into a gaming machine , a camcorder or a digital camera , an mp3-player , a movie viewer , a voice recorder , a personal secretary , a gps map browser , a book , a multifunction remote controller , practically everything that you can do with the computer , plus it is a phone ( ! ! ) and also you can carry it in your pocket : ) .	1
it still smelled .	0
i also use the phone as my modem via bluetooth to my apple powerbook !	1
otherwise , get a smaller single speed router , which will be much easier to use freehand and is all you need for smaller diameter bits .	0
the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . ) 	1
while i am not happy that a solid state device died after such a short period of time , my quick review of this product space did not yield any other brands that seem much better than linksys .	1
i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason . 	0
rks almost without fail , no matter what your taste in music is : from relaxation music to hard rock , to hip hop , to korean and japanese , to afro-cuban and salsa , jazz , blues , country and pop , this feature performs well .	1
the software failed repeatedly . 	0
am so glad i bought this camera .	1
bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices . 	1
i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it . 	1
3 ) user replaceable battery 	1
but , it seems to work so well now , that i do n't anticipate any problems with it . 	1
it looks great - and is loaded with features . 	1
go for the champ .	1
i couldn 't believe what i had been missing .	1
it also works just fine for international calls .	1
i have had no problems with the phone . 	1
finally , after about a week 's use , the screen started to freeze on me .	0
there are instructions to encrypt your personal wirless network so no one else can end up hogging / stealing your bandwidth .	1
both the antivirus and firewall are integrated into one piece of software and they update together .	1
not so nice things : - a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use - spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing ( outside of a table ) - the 1 / 4 " chuck sleeve requires much tightening to keep bits from slipping	0
the sd500 rivals the canon g6 in image quality .	1
really like it , easy to use , great images , very intuitive , fits in my jacket pocket .	1
i love all of the features , and presets as well . 	1
i have had no problem either with backward compatiaibility , in that the " mixed mode " feature lets you both 54 and 11 mb cards off the router .	1
in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control . 	0
the volume . 	0
as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible . 	1
they say that they are the best pictures they have ever see from a compact .	1
* holds the odor in nicely !	1
getting the router setup in a " vanilla " configuration that works for 99 % of users was very easy , and i was able to do this no problem .	1
it gives you the most bang for your buck , period .	1
i left the camera in my car in maine ( not a very hot place ) and the lcd screen cracked !	0
if you are looking for a small camera to throw in your pocket , take great pics and video , get the sd500 .	1
and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control . 	0
i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all . 	0
the player 's mechanics are also flawed . 	0
i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful . 	1
getting files onto it is quick and painless . 	1
i want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason .	1
- bright , visible screen 	1
i try navigating using the player 's built in menu , and it still would n't work ! 	0
unlike my 3 other mp3 players , this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks . 	0
removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years . 	1
this is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory , for example .	1
this is only a problem at night , during the day the screen is very easy to see .	0
i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy . 	1
the games are decent , but u only get 2 to start off with .	1
not only is it inconvenient , but also the battery life span is short .	0
it constantly drops the internet connection and simple things like walls in our house block the link so everything is very slow .	0
settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints . 	1
perhaps semantic could work out the efficiency a little , but these reviews are highly exagerated ... i would ask what else these people are running on their computers ( ? )	1
on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured . 	1
this phone has a nice blend of features without going overboard .	1
and the phone has a very cool feature wich allows you to send images via a normal pop3 / smtp e-mail account .	1
forget about the sleek looks if it can 't play some of your real dvds. 	0
this isn 't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play aeroplane with this , are you .	1
now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equilizer type deals on here . 	1
in any case , navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders . 	0
nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price . 	1
i had the second one for less than two weeks when i noticed a rattling / humming / buzzing sound while music was played .	0
it beats apple on the storage space , it beats apple on the removable battery ( and batter life ) , and i personally like its interface more than the ipod scroll wheel .	1
along the way we compared it to my wife 's t720i and the 6600 was superior in terms of battery life , connectivity bars and features .	1
i can recommend this phone to anyone , anytime . 	1
the powershot g3 is a great camera . 	1
solid food poop is very stinky and this diaper pail doesn 't really contain the smell .	0
the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press . 	0
i have less money invested in the router table and dual routers than i would have if i had purchased a single cheap reliant shaper .	1
i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have n't had any problems . 	1
( on here of course ) also , a couple dvd 's would n't play and they were new ones ! 	0
however after purchasing a 20 gb ipod it 's clear to see the superiority .	1
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) . 	1
to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player . 	1
slow-syncro flash , macro / infinity mode , etc .	1
this is a quality product , not to be confused with teh cheap junk that hitachi gets manufactured in china .	1
not only is it much more cost effective ( you can use regular trash bags rather than refills at $ 5 a pop ) , it is easier to use and clean , and has a larger capacity .	1
no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers . 	1
feature wise , its a lot better than the dlink and netgear routers out there .	1
only if we could get one camera in it . . 	0
however , if there was one thing i liked about the creative , it would be the car adapter .	1
it looks really sleek and stylish , and does everything it claims . 	1
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub-par . 	0
3 ) joy stick for eazy navigation , 35mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff .	1
- not compatible with audible.com books .	0
maybe this new design is more durable than the last , but i kind of doubt it .	0
but from my experience , by the time it gets to that point , the bag is really heavy , so i think this is kind of helpful- it 's a built-in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying .	1
unfortunately , the player would not read any of my region one dvds. even though they were not damaged in any way . 	0
i decided to save the $ $ and opted for the zen xtra ... and i was not disappointed . 	1
and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ). 	1
the main advantage of this system over its predecessor is the ability to open a wider pipeline between clients .	1
b. fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2.4 ghz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive . 	1
battery life is ok . 	1
i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero . 	0
all of this said [ as it 's on it 's way back to amazon ] , the one song it did include provided far better sound than the ipod .	1
the player is great .	1
i just wished that it didn 't fill up so fast !	0
all of the wireless components that i bought were a breeze to set up as well .	1
i am really impressed by this dvd player . 	1
i enthusiastically recommend this camera . 	1
who wants to pay $ 30 to discuss a defect in a product that just cost $ 95 ? ( i also bought the back-up cd ) .	0
original review december 2004 i 'm sorry to read about other people having problems with their zen micro , but mine has worked great !	1
this router has soft start and runs smooth and true .	1
when you learn how to change some settings , you can make the quality even better	1
i have never had this problem with any other software on my computer .	0
overall i 'm happy with my toy . 	1
second , the setup cd actually worked perfectly .	1
aside from a 6mb + + built-in phone memory , there 's a 32mb mmc card that goes with it !	1
great video clip quality for a digital camera - so much better than my old one ( canon a60 ( ? ) ... the 2.0 megapixel one ) .	1
i first used the router in the free hand mode and liked it a lot .	1
the screen is clear and readable , and the touch pad works very well , it took me less than a day to get the hang of it , and now i like it better than having to click buttons or fiddle with a separate volume control .	1
i 'm going to try to get a refund but considering all the hoops i jumped through ( emails , downloads , reboots , a purge and another download , plus reading through the help menu ) a refund should be twice as frustrating .	0
the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen . 	1
yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway . 	0
software - the software is crap . 	0
the player usually plays dvd 's , but has occasional problems such as : 1 ) not recognizing a dvd 2 ) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 ) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd . 	0
i like the automatic key lock function . 	1
accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive . 	1
the white-led backlit lcd is very bright and crisp , even in sunlight , and relatively easy on the battery .	1
oh , and another is the cool " halo " light that surrounds the touch pad , and light 's up when you touch the screen , and how the light glows when the zen is connected to the computer .	1
1 ) a spare battery would have been great . 	0
) creative , inc. the maker includes the barest of the bare minimum in the box , then through gross profiteering nickles and dimes you on every single accessory at extraordinarily inflated prices .	0
while the perfect ordor free diaper pail has yet to be invented , the diaper champ is a good as it gets .	1
handset quality is great , as is the speakerphone quality and the headset audio quality .	1
they 're easy to use .	1
camera is a paper weight .	1
the quality is significant and you 'll be very happy from saving time and the headache .	1
when i saw a high gain ( low price ) antenna was available to the wrt54g router , i thought i 'd happily give up some ( practically unattainable anyway , since you 've got to be in spitting distance from the router ) speed in favour of wider coverage .	1
unarguably better than apple 's , and nice earbuds to boot .	1
good color and very little needed to correct photos on paintshop pro .	1
it 's easy to install the security on this product but linksys doesn 't do a good job of explaining why its important .	1
i 've yet to find the limitation for this hitachi ( my only hitachi tool , by the way ) and quite frankly , i don 't know that i have the muscle to push this machine any harder .	1
i still have my s70 because i like the wider lens sometimes , but in general , if you are looking for a small camera with the whole package , the sd500 is the only one you should buy .	1
i hooked the linksys wireless router up to a broadband connection which is running at a maximum of 700 plus kilobytes on the download e !	1
the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do . 	0
a decent camera phone for taking quick pictures , movies , and having general all around fun with .	1
there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient . 	0
i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far . 	1
plus , if you order from amazon.com , they will exchange it for you no problem .	1
the battery life is amazing . 	1
i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) . 	0
just don 't get drawn into t-mobile 's catchy rebate .	0
opening the champ to empty out the bag is a little tricky- i pinched my thumb a few times before i got the hang of it .	0
also , i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds ( my old apex ad-1200 had trouble with these ) . 	1
2 ) the remote works , but then it does not work , and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong . 	0
its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge ( not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips ) .	0
it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket . 	1
it feels tiny in the hand without it .	1
the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing . 	1
however , it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips . 	0
i originally gave this camera 5 stars . when i had windows 98 it was wonderful but i got a new computer last november with xp the usb software is sooo ... not compatible with xp	0
this item is exceptional i like the ease of use and it held the odor in great .	1
it also has a voice recorder and fm radio that you can only get on an ipod if you but an adapter seperately .	1
the optical and digital zooms combine to give an effective 4x zoom .	1
the installation , set-up , and operating interfaces are well organized and intuitive and the email spam component works well .	1
its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n't sinc with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , ect. like the ipod ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device ) . 	0
in auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera .	1
the design of the collets is excellent and far exceeds any of the craftman ( toy / junk ) routers i have previously purchased .	1
i think it is a combination of the program size taking up resources and the open / close scanning that it does with every program .	0
i have been very impressed with my purchase of the sd500 i bought it at the beginning of the month as the ultimate pocket camera and have shot 300 images so far with it .	1
otherwise , it is difficult to figure out and awkward . 	0
1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility . 	1
the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close , a very annoying thing after ahwile . 	0
i have had the ipod mini and it performs on the level with my sound card but the micro beats it outright .	1
digital zoom is clear too ... say you used all 3x optical zoom , try to do digital zoom then ... just try not to shake the camera at all and you 'll still get a clear good quality picture	1
no inbox accessories-- an arm strap , belt strap , case , or anything would be nice , but nope ... moveable parts-- this makes me almost want to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th ; with moveable parts , its easy to damage an ipod at a gym , so this is for more casual listeners ; note the ipod mini doesn 't have moveable parts and is made of titanium .	0
so far the dvd works so i hope it does n't break down like the reviews i 've read . 	1
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use . 	1
turn the camera on while pressing the button ( or is it the menu button ? i have to check again = ) ) and it 'l show you the time and date .	1
it doesn 't bog down under load .	1
both are very easy to learn & use , and intuitive enough for even a novice . 	1
the camera is adequate and if i want high-res photos i 'll use my digital camera instead .	1
the buttons on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly . 	0
unlike other reviewers , i have found the support to be responsive , almost no wait time on the phone , and relatively knowledgeable .	1
they look fantastic . 	1
further , the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the ipod .	1
1.the phone has the best keypad any nokia phone has to offer .	1
back in may 2004 , when i first reviewed this , it had taken me over 16 hours to install and run .	0
ease of use / design : the ipod is a very easy to use mp3 player , and if you can 't figure this out , you shouldn 't even own one .	1
very easy to use for someone like me who 's just hopping on the digital camera bandwagon .	1
we bought this about 6 months ago and it 's been worthless .	0
also , for those that complain that the diaper champ isn 't as effective as time passes , keep the following in mind : as babies get older , their diets changes ( aka solid foods ! ) and so does the smell of their diapers !	0
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy . 	1
the bottom line is " phone is cool one - only for the moment , as its the latest phone in the market and has all the new features , but this will soon be displaced by upcoming newer phones " .	1
the image quality is excellent . 	1
using supplied s / w , you can transfer all addresses from a different nokia phone into it .	1
also if you want a device that does soo much more than the ipod mini but is at the same price , this is the player for you .	1
i have noted that as you use the tool , sawdust builds in the channel and it requires attention .	0
after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile ! 	0
creative software stinks . 	0
. even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image 	0
it played only one out of three dvd 's without problems , the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches . 	0
but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street .. . 	1
the thought of not having to buy refills and just using regular bags is awesome !	1
if you use linux and want grps and / or want to use a handsfree bluetooth device , and want a decent camera -- this is the phone for you .	1
but , the creative zen micro is plagued by a serious , serious stupid and elemenatary design flaw , and i 'm going to tell you what it is ... but first , two more things about this piece of garbage that 's so great and could 've made it a potenial ipod killer .	0
it did play a dvd-r which was unplayable in my older philips machine . 	1
the controls on the player are very simple , no need for a manual . 	1
sometimes when you press buttons , the menu appears after a second or two .	0
i 'm sure i don 't use it to the degree of some of the other purchasers , but i really like it !	1
- looks sleek , compact , has a radio .	1
this camera has a major design flaw . 	0
the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust . 	1
i have overall been disappointed with nokia in the past , finding that samsung and motorola tended to have better quality phones .	0
the greatest thing about the software ( in my humble ) is that it reads your cd info .	1
last , i find the price a bit expensive for a product such as this .	0
all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player . 	1
other than that , i love this camera .	1
sure , it slows it down a little , but that 's expected .	1
speaker volume is loud and clear but it sacrifaces the battery life .	0
i compared this to a lot of other cameras , believe me , it 's value for money . 	1
overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view . 	1
in fact , i liked it so much after using it with my son who is now 2 years old , that i bought one for our new baby 's room .	1
glad to see the ed. revised the previous statements regarding image quality .	1
the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player . 	0
can 't beat carrying 500-cd collection with me wherever i go . 	1
the program is fully featured , with much of what you 'd want from a security program --	1
2 ) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it . 	0
sound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod . 	1
we have never had any problems with anything like loose wipes getting stuck ( we always wrap them in the dirty diaper ) .	1
n6600 supports midi , wav , amr , mp3 etc .	1
there is no photo viewing option , however , there is a 20 gb photo ipod , but it costs $ 20 more .	0
having the digic ii chip helps a lot .	1
the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect . 	1
only then did i learn the truth -- this phone does not work with palm pdas !	0
1 speakers at home , i rarely use it with the earbuds , though they are much better than the ones you normally get with other mp3 players .	1
because this camera is beautiful . 	1
it has it all .	1
for the hobbiest , it 's probably a nice buy .	1
it is made of plastic . 	0
when the player was working it was great ,but . 	0
one still works fine , the other quit after one day . 	0
if you have no previous version of nortron security on your system , or nortron antivirus , the installation will go fine , otherwise dig in and in to do a major registery clean up ! the old programs will leave a trace that will mess up the new installation , even if you uninstalled the old programs perfectly .	0
the best part about this router is now i have a dhcp server .	1
im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button ! 	1
we tried it out christmas night and it worked great . 	1
nice things about the m12v : - in a table , the powerful 3 1 / 4 hp motor is great - soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on - continuously variable speed control - amazon 's price	1
decently sized screen-- one of the larger ones on the market at 2 "	1
i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for . 	0
by the way , it looks nice also . 	1
the micro has an impressive array of very nice features and a well designed user interface .	1
this is overall the best point and shoot camera i 've used .	1
the picture quality of this camera is outstanding ( taking its ' size and price into consideration ) .	1
although , i thought it could 've been designed a bit better .	0
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot . 	1
they have the worst service of any of the major companies .	0
the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this . 	0
- the unit is easy to use and intuitive . 	1
this product is way cooler than anything ive used before ( pccillins and mccafees and norton antivirus alone ) .	1
i 've had almost no problems with the firmware ( ie , lock-ups , shut-downs etc ) , but i have kept the player up to date .	1
its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed &#38; phone lying by your pillowside . 	1
the guide fence for freehand routing is well made and solid .	1
this way i never have to be ripped off by the carrier for stupid ringtones , i can get whatever i want .	1
this camera is truely superb .	1
5 ) bluetooth wireless technology , so that i can transfer data to and from my computer without messing with any cables .	1
but about 25 % of dvd 's i 've played on ithave a problem , when watching a movie the picture will freeze , but the dvd still plays , and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments . 	0
it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd . 	0
i can tell using the phone that it feels a little flimsier than motorolas do , but as long as i 'm not planning on dropping the phone or running over it with my car it should be just fine .	1
- included creative software is pretty poor . 	0
it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop . 	1
- the cover that came with it did n't fit very well 	0
after consulting with creative 's customer support , they determined that the hard drive was broken and the only recourse was to send it in for repair , which would cost me $ 40 , since it 's past the 90 day warranty ( pretty short warranty ) .	0
this is a great product !	1
it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep . 	1
anyhow some demerits of this phone , the phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most nokia variants .	0
and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey ! 	1
the edge guide has a nice micro adjust feature that works well .	1
10 ) multiple play modes - tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc. , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter . 	1
the controls and the menus are clearly displayed and easily fathomed	1
you have to wonder why creative can 't get this right .	0
we got two phones for the t-mobile family plan ( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan ) and one came with a broken headphone ( can hear but cannot be heard ) and one died today after less than two weeks of use . 	0
( we wrap them nice and tight ) * we use our regular kitchen trash bags--cheap !	1
this is the fourth version of systemworks and the second version of internet security that i have used and it has always been a favorite .	1
it comes with an adapter to plug into the wall , which i hear is a step up from the other ipods , which require you plug it into a computer to charge it .	1
i couldn 't get the install wizard to work .	0
2 . it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow . 	0
i take a lot of pictures and this camera is my first choice .	1
creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean .	1
my son tried it and he too couldn 't change the speed without an assist .	0
but be prepared to buy something else ( diaper genie ? ) which can trap the odor better .	0
it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button . 	0
i have a canon a 70 , and now this sd500 , its amazing , how this little camera produces , such great pics , it even brings out ur pimples on the face .	1
this phone has the best battery , it lasts longer then my old 3210	1
feedback on creative 's product support is universally poor ; this is not limited to the zen , it applies to all the company 's products . 	0
only owned it about two weeks so i expect we 're looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon . 	0
purchased the ad-2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it . 	0
it wo n't play 80 % of my movies , which are all store boughten . 	0
overall this is a slightly better than average phone . 	1
we use regular kitchen sized garbage bags .	1
great price . 	1
however , it has failed to deliver on quality . 	0
i have owned this camera for a short time and would n't give it up for anything . 	1
4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking . 	1
with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality . 	1
within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob . 	0
also , the fit and finish could be better although this doesn 't detract from performance .	0
the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid . 	0
5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing . 	0
surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available . 	1
in conclusion , this player is beautiful .	1
the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use . 	1
when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat . 	1
i was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work , to no avail .	0
also , it was only $ 39.99 ( after rebate ) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player . 	1
with this mp3 player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod . 	1
operation : it 's like bmw 's i-drive - it does it 's job , but has the most unintuitive , overly-layered interface .	0
although it has chubby hips , the device isn 't really so big .	1
huge storage space , i loaded my entire collection of music , which isnt that much , 400 songs , and still have 26 gb , out of the 28 provided to you . 	1
ripping your songs and creating playlists could n't be any easier . 	1
f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the asthetics bit down , of course 	0
features : really , there aren 't any features , unless you call the games a feature .	0
i have to say that i am very happy with it so far .	1
i have owned some kind of creative audio product since 1993 and have never had to call tech support .	1
* you can 't turn the volume up very high , but i think this might be for health reasons . *	0
there are number of downloads needed / available for this phone & they will be texted to you at no cost .	1
as with most headphones that come with any type of music player , i recommend throwing these into the nearest river , unless you like having hard , round pieces of plastic in your ears .	0
despite the things that i have listed so far , i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work , to the gym , in the car , etc. . 	1
the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details . 	1
the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective . 	0
i dont use the belt clip cuz it fails to hold the player securely ( design problem ) .	0
the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds . 	1
the touch controls took a little getting used to but now i wouldn 't change it for the scroll wheel .	0
but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive ! 	1
it is a bit cumbersome , and i can 't get to the songs i want as quickly . 	0
[ + ] [ s ] # # buy the zen ! "	1
while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability . 	1
i like to take pictures when i go out at night and perhaps some people would complain that noise levels are high at higher iso 's but i don 't really care that much , i think it gives the pictures a certain real-life quality .	1
i absolutely love it .	1
moreover , apart from the plastic cable cover , the camera has a nice , solid feel about it , and it 's so tiny , i take it with me wherever i go .	1
so much packed in a small case and very affordable ! 	1
it 's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers .	1
the player 's software is very easy to use and very good . 	1
this is a good deal for music and data storage . 	1
when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is . 	1
really happy with this little camera . 	1
unlike other reviewers , i like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the router table .	1
the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did . 	1
i 've had this camera just over 2 years and it takes pretty good pictures .	1
the ease of use of the ipod is a major attribute .	1
) worst feature possible , this alone makes it rate one star : what 's up with no recharge cord ?	0
- sound quality : excellent , everything you would expect from this company . 	1
i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred . 	1
after we discovered the problems , we tried to contact apex ( fkor 3 months ) , but we never got in touch with them.the customer support telephone number is always busy , and they do not answer their web customer support . 	0
i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes ! 	0
all in all , the diaper champ serves its purpose , but it does not live up to its good reviews .	0
i 'm giving this player cautious recommendation . 	1
i 'd give it 5 stars if the automatic modes were better and if there were true manual focus and exposure modes .	0
not a killer problem , but not well done , either .	0
i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs . 	1
cranking the master volume level up past the mark of the bar only leads to distortion and compromised sound quality .	0
so loud , really , that it does n't work terribly well as a silent ringer option . 	0
the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it . 	1
so reliability is the winner here for the ipod .	1
usb 2.0 transfer is insanely fast . 	1
you won 't need to update your firewall and antivirus separately or install two disks .	1
i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder . 	1
no vibration !	1
their customer ( www.apexdigitalinc.com ) service is very poor . 	0
this linksys router does it for the right price .	1
the soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation .	1
i was using a motorola t720i with verizon and i had alot of dropped calls and i had troubles syncing data .	0
it 's easy to use . not too small , and not too big .	1
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly . 	1
nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear . 	1
when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra - it 's that good ! 	1
it 's shorter , sleeker , more compact and fits comfortably in my small hand than the ipod ... my nokia cell phone towers over this bad boy !	1
relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots . 	0
and the battery life is bad !	0
the macro mode is exceptional , the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject . 	1
first , the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds . 	0
i recommend t-mobile and the nokia 6600 without reservation .	1
it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen . 	1
( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format . 	0
the storage capacity is great . 	1
when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd - r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with . 	1
the included headphones suck , so get your own .	0
it works great .	1
if you can get one with all the accessories and a cheap extended warranty , this is the player to get ! highly recommended .	1
works pretty well .	1
also , it takes any kitchen sized trash bag , so there is no special bag to stock .	1
i got about 700 loaded up before it told me i was full , and at that point , i was ready to toss it out the window .	0
i really regret signing up with t-mobile , but i 'm stuck with them for the next 6 months of the contract .	0
i still can 't believe how fast it starts up .	1
awesome for the newbie , though i personally like to fasten every bolt myself .	1
- well-backlit keypad 	1
overall it is a great unit & hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it . 	1
overall this tool is very well worth the price and i have no regrets about my purchase .	1
these include : mp3 , wave , wma , wma pro , and wma lossless ; it is very user-friendly simply by right-clicking the file ( s ) to be converted .	1
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu . 	0
other mp3 players won 't give you the sonic clarity of the zen at this compression level , so i imagine they won 't at lower ones , either .	1
why did i wait so long ? detail [ -1 ] , color rendition [ -1 ] [ cc ] # # if you 're looking for a digital camera to replace your big nikon or canon slr , forget it - film is still king when exquisite detail and fine color rendition are critical .	0
the sd500 has only been in my possession for a little over 3 months , and the lcd has been broken twice .	0
retraction : said mine had silver plate : it does have display . 	1
- this did not feel like quality construction and i was n't sure how long it would last . 	0
pertaining to the speed issue : i got 54mps while i was in the same room .	1
i rarely get drawn in by mass-commercialism , but something about the ipod made me say , in the words of lou and andy , " i want that one ! " i was willing to shell out	1
