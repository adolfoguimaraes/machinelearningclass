anyway , my wife got this for me for my birthday and i love the thing .
secondly , all info can be sent to a computer and w / o the hassle of usb wires .
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference .
1 ) it is perhaps too small .
despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box !
apple has definately fulfilled its reputation in making quality equipment , and surprisingly wasn 't as expensive as its reputation normally holds .
however , symantec has taken a significant turn for the worse with this release .
there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , zoom etc .
the first one would n't work from the start .
its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide-angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake .
however , this ultracompact allows the photographer to personalize his or her shooting preferences through a variety of preset and user definable modes .
otherwise , this is a great " alternative " mp3 player for those of use who don 't want to worship the mighty all-powerful apple .
the menu pops up after 3 seconds the picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory .
the heavy motor and continuously variable speed control let this router churn through everything i threw at it .
but if i installed either one of these norton products , neither works after installation ?
also i like the position of all the controls and the fact that it doesn 't have any extra knobs or gizmos .
the hardcase they give with it must work well .
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .
it works better and has more useful features than nis 2003 .
i 'm currently using a sony vaio s-150 ( which i bought at the end of this past august ) , and it takes about five minutes just to boot the system - in fact , i 've taken to just hibernating , rather than shutting down completely .
it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i.e. organizer ) , and the radio !
there is little meaningful difference between the two versions aside from the tedius activation process , and the product is currently rather buggy and has problems running unless cleanly installed on a formatted drive .
norton 's memory usage on systems with 512 mb is very low .
you need the software to actually transfer files
i have trashed this product on other opinion sites based on this major flaw alone .
the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .
there are some highs to the 2004 edition , but mostly lows .
its ability to serve as a back-up for my music collection is a huge plus.
basically the 6600 is a bundle of over-hyped features you don 't and won 't need ( if you do get yourself a pda or pocket pc ) , none of them work as they should , and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average .
1 ) frame freezes and the family yells , " dad ! somethings wrong with the dvd player ! come quick ! "
it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket .
the accesories that come with the player are great .
i read many reviews on norton i.s. 2004 from a variety of sources ( cnet , amazon , message boards ) and came to the conclusion that nis 04 was a terrible product and not worth the update .
this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly .
- the unit itself its well structured , with just the buttons you need and none you do n't .
this is a great phone i have this phone since feb 04 and i never have any problem at all .
sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products .
you have to purchase that separately for some outrageous cost .
to my amazement , even that process was error-prone .
the good news is that the creative support is very responsive and after some emails and postal exchanges , i had a new zen .
the zen offered a great alternative .
while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player .
possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .
the internet connection would go down every 5 mins when i used it with a p2p program called bitspirit .
solid , squeak-free , large screen .
with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great .
if you are using linux , and you want to use gprs to connect to the net , i suggest this phone along with a belkin usb bluetooth adapter .
- no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones .
i got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags .
i have about 6 gb used on my ipod so far ( well over 1000 songs ) , and as far as i can tell , all of them play at near-cd quality .
overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod !
20 gb or 40 gb ? the pros of the 40 gb : comes with a " dock station " and double storage space ( 10,000 songs ) .
as an engineer , i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale .
works perfectly with my netgear wireless pcmcia .
i will never use all the " whistles and bells " this machine is capable of .
the karma is only $ 5 more , it 's small , had a 20 gig drive and supports more formats including ogg .
one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 .
this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues .
in addition it is very easy to setup .
at works as well as can be expected for products in this space and the company backs it up with good support .
and man ... i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player ... because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title ..
once it froze so bad i couldn 't even use the power button to turn it off , and had to open and take out the battery .
the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery .
it doesn 't stink , ever ( like some have assumed since it doesn 't wrap each diaper into its own neat little cocoon ) .
overall it is the best camera on the market .
placement of the buttons and software user interface is near perfect .
you can use it as a storage hard drive .
it practically plays almost everything you give it .
bottom line is that at $ 160 , this is an absolute steal .
- great sound ! i was very impressed , i encode at 192 kbps and the audio quality is great , especially with the better headphones .
the product also leaves a faint smell in the room .
my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the cdds service , the ripping process fails to populate the " year " field .
2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use .
i purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of nokia phones available .
the only not-so-positive comment i have is about the depth adjustment , it is not easy to micro-adjust accurately .
in fact , i 'd have to rate it among the worst i 've ever encountered .
the handles make it very comfortable to use and i experience little vibration .
this new click wheel ipod allows you to navigate through the menus and song via a touch-wheel for scrolling and click-able buttons for selection .
it is without even a slight doubt , my new favorite .
additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screensaver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc. )
incredible memory !
and it 's the largest diaper pail i 've seen without taking up more floor space .
i also removed the springs in the plunge tubes to make it easier to raise .
some people have commented about the size and weight of the phone , and it has rightfully gotten the nick-name " the bar of soap " which , it really is .
this is a must have product for all new moms !
the colors are a joke , and i personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad .
headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature .
why would anyone buy this when you can get a 20gb ipod that will hold 4 times the number of songs ( and even more if aac encoding is used ) for the same price ? ? ?
other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips .
it feels like i 'm back to the days of 56k dial-up internet service , even though i 'm running a dell 2ghz pentium 4 with 256mb memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year .
2 ) storage capacity
who wants to go through the hassles of loading software onto a " foreign " computer just to move over some simple ( * .txt ) files ?
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player .
what a kick butt mp3 machine and the freedom to get songs from a reasonable source , instead of paying for them two or three times , then get the creative zen ipod killer , kiss my ass itunes !
this product sucks , the customer service from apex sucks .
yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range .
among its weak points is the mmc slot location and a bit vague design .
it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly .
i got this for christmas , and it is a great gift .
what dissapointes me the most that a software like that is not cheap gets zero support form symantec , if you want support , they 'll charge you a fee !
sound quality is great , fm tuner is fine , as is the recorder .
but , sometimes , if the champ is too full , the flip handle won 't function .
the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n't be easier to use .
so far i have no complaints with this player .
you actually can talk to a real person for support in under an hour ! ) .
some adjustments in the settings could help make it better .
very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price .
the diaper genie needs it 's own refill bags in order to work and that 's just more money that you don 't have to spend .
because of it 's hidden features ( no macrovision , non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region dvd 's .
it is a great phone , if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful features .
the only thing i do n't like about this is the cover does suck .
lastly , the price is fantastic :
the linksys technical support site has nothing about configuring the router for use with a mac .
8 battery life is excellent .
the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera .
i use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty .
the cons , at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth .
i could take 1 / 2 " passes and it still didn 't skip a beat .
i find this feature on this phone useless , but , since i don 't really need this function anyway , i don 't really use it .
the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) .
i 've had this thing for less than a month , treated it quite well , never dropped it , and the headphone jack is all screwed up .
i have ripped over 100 songs from my cd collection and it was so easy and fast , and they all sound great .
small size .
their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience .
comments : overall this is still a great value , but is kind of overrated in the sense that there are beater deals on the market .
1 month , no problems , great phone i 'm very pleased with my 6610 phone .
* does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio ).
it seemed as if we were empting the pail everyday and it was in no way odorless .
using the software itunes is relatively simple , you just plug the usb cable in , wait your machine to detect the ipod and voila , any songs listed in your itunes library will be transfered on over to the ipod .
unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could n't play all my dvds , and now the player can 't play everything .
there were no other obvious setup instructions - though there was a softcopy manual , it did not give an answer readily on what do to .
the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla .
i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand , but with my experience and reading the other reviews , i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product .
so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly .
the pics can be touched up in photoshop , and be printed at 4x6 and they look great !
it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light .
good sound-- plays very nicely , even though the stock headphones are kind of weak durable-- not the most durable because its mostly plastic , but very compact and sturdy
still , that 's enough time that i 'm still satisfied , if a bit grouchy with creative 's overhyped promises .
other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as i 'd like them ,
cuts are easy and smooth .
in addition , i don 't believe that it is odorless .
they really are awfully small .
+ sorts music by artist , album , genre , etc ... it 's easy to wade through 5 gigs of tunes to find what you 're looking for .
i will never buy their product again at this rate , and neither should you .
the dynamic range seems not quite as good as the kodak dc260 .
i am soooo pleased with this product ! ! !
i tried e-mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable .
with the ipod , you can also store documents and contact files ( from programs such as microsoft outlook ) when it 's connected to your pc as an external hard drive .
5 ) video recorder is of no use and one cannot record something useful in 10 seconds and it takes a while to send the same through the " free picture and video messaging " offered by service provider .
the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack .
i haven 't tried to set up any advanced features on the router , but it is not difficult to set up for basic use .
the pictures are tack sharp , colors are vivid , and at 7 mega pixels the quality is plenty high to manipulate and crop images to your hearts desire .
the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality .
it has an exterior design that combines form and function more elegantly than any point-and-shoot we 've ever tested .
this camera is an excellent choice for an ultracompact , take anywhere device and boasts an outstanding movie mode to boot .
i think the os and controls are very well thought out and although i 'll admit i was a bit intimidated during my first few hours with the micro , the interface and controls became second nature after the first day or so .
the battery is removable .
it seems to be working fine , but we 've not used it all that much .
anyhow , this software is working fine and no problems since i installed it two weeks ago .
all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once , but it has n't done it since .
i 've owned many norton products in my time , and for the most part , i 've been pleased with their performance .
this product is absolutely not ready for release .
it is buggy , slow and basically frustrates the heck out of the user .
the touchpad is virtually unusable -- sometimes you have to press like mad to make a selection and other times the slightest brush causes something to be selected that you don 't want .
so far ( 3 weeks ) , we 've had no problems with the diaper champ at all .
there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good .
i simply hate symantec . i swear , if i could have physically ripped that software out of my computer with my bare , bleeding hands , i would have .
the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out !
silverish color really adds a special touch .
the installation software cd crashed repeatedly .
a couple of times a week it seems to cease access to the internet .
i would recommend this camera unequivocally !
you also need to go in and manually remove many symantec files from the registry .
the other annoyance with this that you have to remove every single remnant of previous version of norton systemworks before you installs this .
and the tech writers have made the installation process so easy for people lik my aunt to follow .
this is a great deal , and i 'm elated with my decision to go with hitachi 's green machine .
the new drivers on cannon 's site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software .
warning ! the windows " remove program " feature does not do a good job of this , and neither does norton 's own removal program .
i have stored 40 audio cds and i still have close to 2.8 gb free .
even though i have the parental controls off it constantly starts updating them then freezes my computer .
the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n't see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel
00 % good though , and the zen does have a few drawbacks .
this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product .
overall , this product is awesome .
the zen was an impressive purchase and i would highly recommend it to anyone using napster .
picture and video quality is ok .
3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust .
i had tried to uninstall norton internet security a few weeks ago , and it wouldn 't let me do that either .
the extra gb is just a bonus .
the battery does not last 12 hours .
the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .
it 's such a great camera ! i think it really was worth the investment = )
this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38; very convenient to scroll in menu etc .
the software , mediasource , cannot work on my pc . ( laptop , intel p4-2.0 , xp os ) .
it 's a great looking , easy-to-use device but it 's the sound quality which is truly amazing -- far better than my sony mini-disc player .
it would either not play the song at all , or skip wildly , no matter that the unit was resting on my desk .
i also wanted to switch to broadcom hardware ( which the linksys uses ) because my wifi minipci card in my dell laptop with lucent silicon in it used 70 % of my 1.2ghz laptop 's cpu when using the wireless at full speed .
overall i 'm incredibly impressed with my new zen touch .
it is a bit difficult to get the unit open ( the advice to take it slowly is sound ) , but now that our son is walking and exploring , i consider this a positive attribute !
very good balance in the hands and lighter than most 3 1 / 4 hp models .
i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category .
creative was defiantly giving the ipod a run for their money with this device .
overall i like the unit .
i got this phone yesterday and didn 't find any problems with it yet .
i 've had no problems at all so far and i 'm very happy .
and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play .
downside : it takes a long time to start up .
it is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags , easy to clean , and most important , easy to use one handed - just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle .
battery : a big big plus .
4 ) the camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away .
the touchpad is annoying sometimes ( give me the click-wheel and pressable buttons any day ) , but not at all as difficult to get over as other people are saying .
all in all , not very good .
while they all seem to have their own positives and negatives , i picked the zen micro over the ipod mini , because i am not an apple person , never has been - i wanted something that is fully compatible with windows media player .
the battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use .
i was fortunate to get the packaging that still included all the accessories ( desk stand / hard case , belt clip , wall charger , etc ) .
in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .
i bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it , or have already bought it--it 's size .
works great ! ! ! !
while i would like to give it 3.5 stars instead of 4 , i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it .
third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer .
it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error .
so the pretty solid router all around good for the money here 's the link to firmware updates http : / / www.sveasoft.com / forum6.html
received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector .
it does have a lense cap , but it wo n't let you take pics with it on which is real good .
it hasnt gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ).
the songs do n't play one after another like on a cd .
this is really a no brainer .
i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked .
this router was a huge disapointment .
the adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with xp so you are forced to create your document then either print it from windows or export it to another application .
i liked this one enough to buy another .
no down time , great signal strength .
1 . it uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills .
the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger , now-blue backlit screen , which is infinitely better .
and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 .
output through component connections looks very good , on my non-hd tv .
i like this router a whole lot better the linksys 11b router it replaced -- the signal strength seems ot be much stroners , seldom falling below the " very good " range ( and most often excellent within 25-50 feet of the router .
also , not liking the gel case .
. the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you can 't avoid that .
my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared .
their products have been great and have saved my bacon on numerous occasions .
versatile and stylish .
you 'll do that because the keys are tightly packed in and your fingers will likely press two keys at once .
it is so small that i am able to keep it in my pocket , and i don 't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable .
i recently bought the linksys wrt54g router and have been very happy with the router itself .
i am very pleased so far .
it was a very quick setup and installation , in fact the disc that it comes with pretty much makes sure you cant mess it up .
the arm band is fantastic and it doesn 't budge even at the gym .
it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar .
excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures .
and the firewall came with a wizard which made it effortless to configure it to my lan .
again , the headphone jack on this thing is garbage .
fyi , battery doesn 't die if you don 't use lcd
after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed .
fits well in hand in trouser pockets .
other than that it is all the same except the new updates .
the top did not fit well into the unit . ( felt defective )
i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it .
the navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy .
- the software that came with it was tough to load .
it 's really well made and has survived sliding across floors and pavement without a scratch .
very sleek & stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has .
. images taken indoor were n't so clear .
and also , it 's priced very affordably .
if this machine just stops on you , unplug it quickly and get out of the way !
the software is very easy to use , and the transfer is super fast !
the other controls are all very easy to use .
i also love that you can flip the device with one hand ...
i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable .
i purchased the elph s100 mainly because i thought it was cool .
the menus are very easy to navigate .
t-mobile was a pretty good server .
now that i have all my music on it there has n't been any more problems .
on the fly play list creation , address book , removable storage drive capabilities , sound recorder , the list goes on people , this thing is literally so chalked full of goodies , it was like halloween all over again .
what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .
the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it ( jpeg , kodak pic 's and dvd-r ) i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good , but my feeling at this time is " two thumbs up " !
it seems to be a much more user friendly company than verizon and a thousand percent better than the horrible quest wireless .
but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in " auto " mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period !
this model appears to be especially good .
it has never worked .
it 's too bad , though , that !
. this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can 't be stopped .
the features are really cool like the radio .
9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time .
first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good .. .
it did also seem to have a strong " new electronics " smell for some time .
i would recommend this product to anyone .
i have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds , no big deal .
the interface used could be better designed .
( it sure does look nice , though ! ) i recommend this to any music lover anywhere : the quality of the audio is excellent , the controls and indicators rapidly become intuitive , and the storage capacity and battery life are huge !
this phone is one of the milestones in the history of the cellular phones .
they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use .
hate to wait between shots
this is by far the nicest one , in so many ways .
the remote is okay , but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons .
i have been impressed with the power of the hitachi m12v .
so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost .
i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds .
nice little phone ... light compact . .
while i have not had the " privilege " , as many call it , of owning an ipod , based on the experience of friends who have had some misfortune with their ipod ( and subsequently purchased the zen touch or zen micro ) , i can pretty much rest assured that my decision to purchase the zen micro was one of the more informed ones .
it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice .
it fits into a hand well , it has a removable battery ( this is important ) , great sound quality , fm stereo , recorder , smooth ui , and a feature that most unipods lack ... char !
+ the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering .
3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture .
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected .
the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus ) .
the entire unit was poorly crafted .
anything this phone does , it does perfectly .
it holds almost a week 's worth of diapers , and you don 't need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work .
i bought the player this week and i like it by far .
the view finder shows crystal clear pictures that will look even better when you get them to the computer .
it is n't big and offensive , though you would n't know it by looking at the pics it takes .
yes , there is a belt clip , but that doesn 't hold the extra battery and usb cable .
i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts , and both were bad .
the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection .
i also tend to like the sliding cover / on switch found on many compact ps cameras since it 's much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot .
i am extremely satisfied with this camera .
the photo quality is amazing .
it has a nice color screen .
in addition , it only seems to work if you 're about five feet away from the player , although that may have been just the batteries that came with it .
besides the one problem , this machine is amazing !
the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine .
for those mac osx users out there , isync works fairly well .
unless you have an enormous music / audio book library , the 20 gb model should have more than adequate storage capacity , with a stated ability to hold 5000 songs .
neither message was answered ( they ask for 24 hours before replying - i 've been waiting 27 days . )
quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time .
namely , it wouldnt sync .
i tried to use the fm radio option , but it doesn 't seem to really pick up the stations i listen , however i am going to try it in a different location , it may have just been my residential location .
but the product iself is great .
they have a good concept here , and i normally expect a lot better quality from creative , so maybe they will do better with the next gen version , but for now i say buyer beware .
if you are already using a previous version of nortron security and unistalled it to install the new version , you will still have all kind of problems in installing the new version on your system !
also , the wma compression format is superior to mp3 , especially at lower bit rates , so i needed a player that could handle wma and integrate well with my windows xp computers .
however , in my mind , $ 299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 months .
this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has .
in low light with flash i found it clear better then the sony p200 ( too much red , colours overall not as natural but fewer red-eyes ) .
reset the network , tried the connection , and it 's working like a charm .
i have found too many bugs in norton internet security professional to recommend it to any one without extreme patience and experience .
the blue backlit lcd looks really neat and is easy to read .
there are a lot of things i like about it .
only used for 3 month before it 's down !
i 've had nokia 's for years , and while this one is packed with whiz bang features it is disappointing for its primary use - a phone .
the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint .
it 's not as stylized as a sony or samsung .
being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable .
6- small but very clear tft screen .
2 ) having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called " unknown . "
the picture is clear , bright and sharp and the sound is good .
it barely holds anything and mine just puts a bunch of thread fuzzies all over the player , because the bag is cheap and seems to be coming apart .
i think sound quality should be the first and foremost feature , and the zen is leaps and bounds better in sound quality , with no need to upgrade the earphones .
p.s. the only snag i encountered while initially configuring the device was trying to hook up the micro to a front usb port . the bus for the front port on my motherboard did not have enough power ; after connecting it to the rear ports , it works perfectly .
the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with " canned air . "
i also had no problems installing or running the camera software on my pc .
it works easily with one hand , which is important .
good image quality .
in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1. for some sizing information ) .
i have no complaints with this mp3 player .
also , the instruction manual is very bad .
i really liked the price ...
- uploading music is quick and easy .
one bad thing though , i find the remote-control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does .
outside of the t-mobile service area the phone seamlessly jumped onto at & t wireless and various other services where the t-mobile service was unavailable .
all in all , this product is definitely one i would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price .
sending the unit to the company of purchase which costs about $ 90 ) , the ability to record with a built-in microphone ( great for recording reminders and meetings ) , very sturdy construction , and not to mention ... the sound quality is excellent !
i compared it to other cd players ( two models of panasonic , rio & samsung ) and they were no way even near zen micro .
the first one lasted about 6 years of heavy use .
my " fast forward " button works , but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go .
it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait .
and amazon.com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ?
otherwise , this player is awesome !
but those 2 come up every time .
great sound ; good interface ; replaceable , powerful battery ; good software ; wake-up , sleep timers ; multiple play modes
gets stinky after a few months , the seal on the piston doesn 't seal anymore .
the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n't take up space on your pc hard drive .
although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent .
but , i am quite unhappy with nokia at the moment .
the fm radio is cool .
the 6610 excels as a cell phone , thank god .
if you haven 't noticed , they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self-timer .
overall , i am very pleased with it .
fact is , it could n't be easier to use .
after some research on the net , i discovered that there is indeed a flaw with the current wrt54g design ( wrt54g , version 3 , which amazon currently sells ) .
the diaper champ is the best we found !
when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off .
this is due to the unusually slow autofocus system .
i highly recommend a nokia 6610 .
so i can 't tell you if diaper champ will be as good at containing the formula generated poop smell , but it 's excellent at containing the smell of poop of my breastfed baby !
i will also say that setting up the e-mail account was very simple and straight-forward , although you do need an external smtp server to use .
a decent peice of hardware with great speed ( i get the same speeds as with my comp connected directly to the modem ) and good signal quality .
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --
first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .
it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it .
this is an excellent router for the money .
i was worried about what the sound quality would be like , but that seems to be just as good as the actual cd sound .
and really this is the best phone one could have .
it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .
it is crystal clear .
the 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of the states and not as well in more remote areas .
i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3.5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it .
the micro seeemed like an ipod for less .
the earbuds that come with it are n't that bad .
this thing does everything but washes your dishes .
after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .
i 've tried playing all of these discs and they all play great .
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad .
i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .
player has a problem with dual-layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2 .
my first router is a safety hazard if you do not pay attention and are not very careful .
i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too .
next , the big reason not to buy any norton product : if there 's a problem with it , norton charges $ 30 to even tell them about it .
and it holds sooooo much music and audio files .
they play just about everything , but # 2 and # 3 died very shortly after getting them .
if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs .
the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption .
we also had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped .
i would highly recommend that you do this if you want to learn something , but if you are not interested in learning this stuff and just want a working wireless router , just get the wrt54g .
the diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into " what diaper smell " in less time than that .
i must say , i think this is the coolest camera i 've ever owned !
they take excellent macro shots as well .
that 's it for now , what are you doing still reading this , click the " add to cart " button already !
1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .
personally , i may never buy symantect products again .
the voice recorders good , but you can 't record songs off the radio for ring tones .
start up , log off , log on ... everything became very slow .
the only downside i see is that it does n't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer .
bottom line ... great product , unbeatable price .
one drop from a pocket or desktop , and it 'd be a goner .
8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .
- the outlook synch only works for non recurring appointments , which personally is very annoying to me but probably wont be to most people . - # # several people complained about the touchpad and frankly i 'm starting to see why .
unit worked great for 3 weeks then video output failed .
the included earphones are pretty good - my advice ?
this is a terrible company with a bad product and awful support .
but now that she is eating solids the odor is escaping out and we are constantly using airfreshner .
we 've purchased 3 universal remotes so far-all claiming to work " apex " dvd players and none worked .
you need to know absolutely nothing about setting up the network .
for a specific location , i still think its a great phone .
the camera 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood .
just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc.
it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones .
the instructions that come with it do n't explain how to make things simple .
what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software .
mine was so bad i had to to use a hammer to free it ( and this is why i 'm giving it 4 , not 5 stars ) .
it just tells you to start disconnecting and attaching cables without any input as to whether your current setup includes a pre-existing router ( mine does ) , without any clarity as to whether you should be running the wizard on a hard-wired pc or a wireless equipped pc .
way less expensive than the ipod .
those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .
the camera does a great job with exposure and prints made with my professional printer looks great ( not as good as prints from my pro digital camera , but still very good ) .
i feel much less likely to drop this phone than others , which are actually starting to get too small .
the disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures , especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can .
just follow the instructions carefully , it 's all based on a cd that has everything you need to get you up and running in no time .
despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography .
some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .
battery life keeps improving on the ipod , and a new ipod will give you up to twelve hours of play time , per charge .
this is quite simply the best you can ask for .
and , other else , the camera is still vga .
- the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch .
4- my idea was that it was an all-in-one , and that theory -once again- proves wrong , this phone excells at nothing , less than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the " other than phone " functionalities , you 'll be disappointed .... if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine .... but don 't expect to get much done .
software is easy to use ( although redhat software is better , but costs money )
believe me when i say this i have used and fingered all nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad
and it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained , which the diaper genie never did !
i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective .
the software comes with plenty of defaults genres .
the ipod comes formatted for the mac , but within seconds of plugging it into a pc , is automatically reformatted for windows . ( the hp version comes with windows formatting , and takes seconds to change to mac . ) although the ipod can be changed from one format to another , you will lose all of your music and data when doing so .
it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds .
this camera is great if you 're used to a high-end slr .
for instance , i made several back-ups of my dvd movies using dvd-r ( w ) and + r ( w ) and it plays the dvds .
apex does n't answer the phone .
you hit the message button on the front and it takes a matter of seconds to bring up the menu .
it really is the perfect travel camera , plus it offers the convenience of digital photography .
the earbuds are great headphones as good as my agk studio 240 , well not as good but darn close .
after installation , the very first time i booted up the creative mediasource organizer , intending to use its cd burning and ripping functions , it totally shorted out .
this product is by far the best broadband router on the market , i bought this to replace one of those linksys instant wireless b routers , worked great for about a year .
the support has been less than impressive , considering the cost .
the pictures are a little dark sometimes .
3 months of use and it no longer recognizes anything .
the firmware has bugs too , so download and install the latest firmware from linksys .
linksys quality and tech support have been outstanding .
2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations .
i tried the cd setup program without any luck .
here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of " plastic-like " ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy .
as for bluetooth , no problems at all .
their site offers no live help at all .
it plays alternate video formats ( vcds , svcds , cvds ) very well .
a great camera , but here are some points which i don 't notice in most of the reviews here , which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer :
sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task .
with the champ all you had to do was drop the dirty diaper into the opening and flip the lid .
configuring it for a home network was almost impossible .
it is a heavy but well-balanced machine , which is an asset when maximum stability is desired .
yes , the features are numerous .
the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .
battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive
the only problem is that occasionally the joystick does start to dig into your thumb while gaming .
the battery issue is superficially a concern , but any reasonable solder-jockey ( such as myself : - ) can pop in a new one when the time comes ( based upon the plentiful info gained from a google for ' ipod battery replacement ' ) .
my last simpler nokia started right up and was immediately ready for use .
the general button placement is not very user friendly .
the phone can use any midi audio file as a ringtone .
even with that , i highly recommend this router - outstanding performer .
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them .
first , the cons ... a tad bulky ... not the most asthetic looking player ... and does n't support a folder stucture .
i would give it about 6 or 7 hours , although it will probably get better after a few charge cycles .
i no longer use it as a plunge router , only as a stationary or table mounted router .
